# Library Management System üìö

Welcome to the Library Management System project! üåü 

This project is designed to demonstrate the application of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using hashmaps and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. It‚Äôs the perfect blend of learning how to manage data effectively while implementing core programming principles.

## Overview

The Library Management System is a simple application that allows users to manage library operations such as adding, searching, and removing books. It utilizes hashmaps to store and retrieve book information efficiently, showcasing how OOP can be used to structure the application.

## Features

- **Add Books**: Add new books to the library with details such as title, author, and ISBN.
- **Search Books**: Quickly find books by title or author using hashmap lookups‚Äîbecause nobody's got time to search through stacks! üìöüîç
- **Remove Books**: Easily remove books from the library when they're checked out or no longer available.
- **Display Books**: List all books currently in the library with their details.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language for this project.
- **HashMap**: Used to store book information for efficient access and modifications.
- **OOP Concepts**: Classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to structure the application.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: 
   ```bash
   cd library-management-system/src
   ```

3. **Compile the Java Files**:
   ```bash
   javac App.java
   ```

4. **Run the Application**: 
   ```bash
   java App
   ```

## How to Use

1. Start the application and choose an option from the menu (Add, Search, Remove, Display).
2. Follow the prompts to input your data.
3. Enjoy managing your virtual library! üìñ‚ú®
